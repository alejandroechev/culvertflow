# CulvertFlow — Reddit Launch Posts

## Post 1: r/civilengineering

**Title:** I built a free browser-based culvert hydraulics calculator (FHWA HDS-5) — no install, no license

**Body:**

I built CulvertFlow, a free web app that does culvert sizing and analysis per FHWA HDS-5. It handles inlet control (submerged and unsubmerged), outlet control with entrance/exit losses, and generates HW-Q rating curves.

Supports circular, rectangular, and elliptical shapes with proper inlet coefficients from the HDS-5 charts. Manning's n values for common pipe materials built in.

No install, no login, no subscription. The math is all public domain (FHWA publication), and the tool is open source.

Would love feedback from engineers who do culvert design — what's missing to make this practical for real projects?

## Post 2: r/hydrology

**Title:** Free browser tool for culvert hydraulics — HDS-5 inlet/outlet control analysis

**Body:**

Built a free web app for culvert hydraulic analysis following FHWA HDS-5 methodology. It determines controlling headwater (inlet vs outlet control), generates rating curves, and handles multiple culvert shapes and inlet types.

All the coefficients from the HDS-5 charts are built in. Just enter your culvert geometry, tailwater conditions, and flow — it does the rest.

What would make this useful for your hydrology work? Looking for feedback.

## Post 3: r/engineering

**Title:** Free culvert design calculator based on FHWA HDS-5 — runs in your browser

**Body:**

I'm building free browser-based alternatives to expensive engineering software. CulvertFlow does culvert hydraulic analysis per FHWA HDS-5 — inlet/outlet control, rating curves, multiple shapes.

All public domain math, open source code, no install or account needed. The goal is to make basic engineering calculations accessible to everyone.

Feedback from practicing engineers would be hugely appreciated.

## Updated Post Footer (add to all posts)

> **A note on this project:** I'm a software engineer exploring what happens when you use AI to build professional tools in domains you're not an expert in. I've built 14 of these so far — across civil engineering, life sciences, optics, and petroleum engineering — and I'm documenting the journey.
>
> The biggest lesson: AI makes coding easy, but **domain expertise is irreplaceable.** These tools work, but they'd be *much* better if built by someone who actually works in this field. If you're a practitioner frustrated by expensive legacy tools, you might be surprised what you can build with AI now.
